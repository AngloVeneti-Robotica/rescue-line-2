Hi, we are AngloVeneti!
We are providing all the files to 3d print our robot here and are a lot.
to understand the how to build the robot there's not a rule you can do as you want, be sure to place all the components as shown in the main STL file "robot.stl"
we are not responsable for any incorrect use, we highly do not reccomend to use these files without having all the hardware pieces compatible.
